COPY - A Simple Photo Gallery
=============================

COPY allows you to create simple web photo galleries organized by date and event.

This package includes two separate applications.

In the 'www' dir, there is the PHP frontend app, that serves galleries stored
in the 'gallery' subdir. Gallery name and date are taken from the info.yaml
file or from the dir name and mtime.

The 'convert' dir includes a simple script that converts your wildcard of images
into subdirs with scaled-down images and thumbnails in the current directory and
prepares the list of images in the info.yaml.

You can easily create and upload all images using:

   mkdir temp
   cd $_
   /path/to/imgconv *.png *.gif *.{jpeg,jpg}
   scp -rp ./web-gallery me@my_server:public_html/galleries/gallery_name

and that's it.

Gallery Info File Format
------------------------

The file format is based on YAML. It contains two documents:
- gallery metadata
- list of images with captions

Metadata are simple "key: value" pairs on separate lines. The keys include

- date - can be used to override the timestamp of the directory.
- name - you can override the dir name if you prefer not using utf8 filenames.
- description - _short_ description. Will be show in the index page.
- author - Useful if the photographer isn't you.

List of images have similar notation as metadata with image filenames as keys
and captions as values. Caption can contain longer comment after the "|" symbol.
Only the photos listed there are included in web gallery. The list also
determines their order.

If you are migrating from the ORIGINAL, you need to use script new_info.py to
convert old info.txt files into the new format.
