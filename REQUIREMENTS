The web backend requires to have a PHP scripting engine running on
your web server. 

convert/imgconv is a plain bash script using Imagemagick to generate thumbnails
and scaling images. You can get Imagemagick at http://www.imagemagick.org/.

# UPDATES #

* netpbm
  ------
   You can use netpbm tools instead of ImageMagick for better speed. You can
   grab netpbm at http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/ but ususally your
   distro ships with it already. My YDL distro has all the toos in netpbm-progs
   package.

If you wan't to have advanced EXIF information for your photos, make sure you
use a recent ImageMagick so that convert doesn't throw away this info when
scaling down. You also need EXIF support in your PHP.


new_info.py
-----------

Script new_info.py can be used to convert ORIGINAL galeries to COPY. It requires
Python 3 and PyYAML library (http://pyyaml.org/)
